                <p>The purpose of this visualization is to walk the viewer through the complicated
                    world of Presidential campaign financing in the United States.
                    All data in this visualization comes from the <a href=http://www.fec.gov>Federal Election Commision</a> (FEC).
                    Each section delves into a different area of campaign financing, with interactive features that
                    allow for filtering and summarizing in order to enhance understanding.</p>

						<p>It's no secret in the United States that it takes a lot of money to win an election. What is not well understood, is
						the amount and source of campaign finances. The FEC is responsible for enforcing federal campaign finance laws, and candidates and
						fundraising committees are required to report all receipts and expenditures. However, with the various laws regulating the frequency, source,
						and amount of funds different groups can contribute, the real picture of just <em>how much</em> money is spent becomes easily obscured.
						With this visualization we seek to better understand both the sources of federal campaign funding, and their impact.</p>

                        <h1>Candidates & Campaign Committees</h1>
						
						<p>The funds that finance American elections come from various groups and special interests, 
						and each kind of organization follows different laws enforced by the FEC.</p>
						
						<p>A <b>candidate committee</b> is a group organized by a particular candidate to support their nomination 
						and election to office. Individual donors can contribute up to $2,700 to candidate committees per election cycle 
						(the two years leading up to an election).</p>
						
						<p>A <b>Political Action Committee</b>, or PAC, is a group formed for the purpose of raising and spending money to support or 
						oppose the election of candidates. Dating back to 1944, PACs can legally contribute money directly to a candidate's 
						committee, national party committee, or other PACs. Federal law limits the contribution of individuals to PACs to a maximum of 
						$5000 per year.</p>
						
						<p>A <b>National Party Committee</b> such as the Democratic National Committee (DNC) or Republican National Committee (RNC), 
						is the official fundraising organization of a political party. Registered with the FEC, National Party Committees can receive 
						up to $33,400 per year from individual contributors.<p>
						
						<p>A <b>Super PAC</b> is a special kind of PAC that makes no direct contributions to candidates or committees, instead financing 
						advertising and other campaign materials independently. Because they are not directly related to a candidate or 
						political committee, Super PACs are not required to follow FEC restrictions on the amount of money raised or spent for the purposes of 
						an election. Legalized by the Supreme Court in 2010, Super PACs and their unlimited funds have changed the playing field of 
						American politics. Super PACs have become a popular vehicle for outside fundraising; while not allowed to officially support a 
						particular candidate, so-called single-candidate Super PACs focus almost exclusively on the election of a single individual.</p>
						
						<p>The following charts show the breakdown of candidates' fundraising totals across the last three presidential elections, 
						and how different types of fundraising committees, sizes of contributions, and locations of donors all play a role in making or breaking 
						a candidate.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12">
						<h2 id="filing-rules">Committee Financial Filing Rules</h2>
						<p>The frequency of reporting varies by the type of committee. Candidate Campaign Committees have the choice to file financial information 
						with the FEC either monthly or quarterly, National Party Committees must report monthly, and PACs and Super PACs can file either monthly or semi-annually.</p>
						<p>In order to compare monthly fundraising and expenditure totals for all types of committees, regardless of their filing schedule, 
						we used itemized contributions and operational expediture data in conjunction with FEC Form 3P filings to determine prorated monthly 
						fundraising and expenditure totals.</p>
						<p>The FEC requires committees to report their itemized receipts for any contribution that exceeds $200. Any receipts below that amount are 
						merely summarized in the committees' monthly, quarterly, or semi-annual Form 3P filings.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-12">
                        <h1>Outside Groups</h1>

                        <p>While outside groups have always played outsized role in American politics, their influence has
                            increased dramatically since 2010. In that year, the United States Supreme Court
                            ruled in <em>Citizens United v. FEC</em> that the first amendment prohibited the government from restricting
                            independent political expenditures - that is contributions to and expenditures made by outside groups
                            not coordinating their activities with a political candidate.</p>

                        <p>Contributions to candidates and their committees are strictly regulated and capped at a
                            relatively low level - in the 2015-2016 election cycle, an individual can give a maximum of $2,700
                            to any candidate committee, or a maximum of $5,000 to a traditional PAC. The aftermath of Citizens United, 
							however was to see a proliferation of "independent-expenditure-only Political Action Committees", 
							also known as Super PACs. Contributions to these groups are entirely uncapped, enabling the wealthiest 
							Americans to have an outized voice in recent elections.</p>

                        <p>To date, since the era of Super PACs began, Super PAC fundraising has been dominated by the Republican side of
                            politics. While Obama in 2012 had a highly funded Super PAC, <em>Priorities USA Action</em>, it served
                            almost entirely as a vehicle to fund attacks against Mitt Romney, rather than by which to promote Obama's
                            candidacy. Pro-democratic outside groups are still relatively more likely to be small-donor traditional PACs
                            run by organizations like trade unions, rather than Super PACs.</p>
